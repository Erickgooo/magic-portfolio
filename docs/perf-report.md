# Performance report

## Fase A — Quick wins (`perf/quick-wins`)

### Lighthouse (median of 3), local `next start`, same machine

- **Date:** 2026-09-26
- **Target:** this worktree's own fresh build (`npm run build && npm run start -- -p 3100`), `http://localhost:3100`
- **Tool:** Lighthouse 12.8.2 CLI (`scripts/perf/lighthouse.mjs`), headless Edge (`CHROME_PATH` = Edge, same binary as `base-local`), default simulated throttling (mobile = Moto G Power / slow 4G; desktop = `--preset=desktop`)
- **Method:** `LH_TAG=quickwins-local npm run perf:lh` (3 runs per page × form factor = 30 reports, all 30 written), `npm run perf:report -- quickwins-local base-local`. Lighthouse's Chrome/Edge process again exited non-zero on every run with the same pre-existing Windows temp-dir `EPERM` cleanup error documented in `docs/perf-baseline.md`; judged by report-file existence, as that doc specifies.

Read alongside `docs/perf-baseline.md`'s own caveat: this local run is noisier and slower across the board than production (no CDN/edge caching, shared dev machine running Playwright/Edge/Node concurrently), so it is a same-machine before/after comparison, not a stand-in for the mobile Perf ≥ 95 / LCP < 2.0 s / CLS < 0.05 / TBT < 200 ms budget in the task brief — that budget is checked against the Vercel Preview in Step 7 (out of scope for this task; see "Open items"). Even so, every metric improved or held on this machine: A11y is 100 on every page (was 86–96), mobile CLS dropped from 0.214–0.774 to 0.000–0.197 (all pages now pass the < 0.05 budget except `about` mobile, at 0.197 — see concerns), TBT roughly halved everywhere it was non-zero, and mobile Total bytes fell sharply (home 3812→756 KB, gallery 1855→645 KB). Mobile Perf scores rose 12–26 points per page but are still below the 95 budget on every page (74–84 on this machine); LCP is still 4.2–5.6 s on this loaded local machine, also below the < 2.0 s budget — both are expected to look materially different on the Preview's isolated, CDN-served environment, but that comparison has not been run yet (Step 7). The local mobile LCP numbers above are dominated by Lantern's simulated network/CPU throttling model, not real render cost: `lcp-breakdown-insight` on this same run attributes only 68 ms (home), 158 ms (about) and 7 ms (gallery, post-11b) of *element render delay* to the page itself, all comfortably under 200 ms — the multi-second LCP is simulated time-to-first-byte/resource-load waiting, which is why the < 2.0 s budget is checked on the Preview (real network, real CDN) rather than here.

### Follow-up 11b — font preload + Gallery LCP eager-load

- **Date:** 2026-09-26
- **Method:** same harness as above. `LH_PAGES=about,gallery,home LH_FORMS=mobile LH_TAG=quickwins-11b npm run perf:lh` (`scripts/perf/lighthouse.mjs` gained `LH_PAGES`/`LH_FORMS` filters for this task — see "Files changed"), then `npm run perf:report -- quickwins-11b quickwins-local`.

**Note on the JS column:** the `home` row's Lighthouse-measured JS transfer moved 344 KB → 302 KB between these two runs, but `next build`'s First Load JS for `/` was unchanged at 311 kB in both of *these* runs (this follow-up only touched font preloads and the Gallery LCP image) — no code that would shrink Home's JS bundle changed between `quickwins-local` and `quickwins-11b`. Treat the 344→302 KB delta as Lighthouse run-to-run/measurement noise (e.g. caching or chunk-loading variance between runs), not a real bundle-size change; First Load JS from the build output is the authoritative number for bundle size. (`/`'s First Load JS later moved to 312 kB in the final fix wave below, from an unrelated accessibility addition — see "First Load JS" below.)

**Correction (post-review, verified against production):** production (`main`, built on Linux/Vercel) already emits font preloads before this branch existed. `curl -s https://www.erickmahecha.com/` and `/about` each show four `<link rel="preload" as="font">` tags: `07844ae7c4262727-s.p.woff2`, `36966cca54120369-s.p.woff2`, `bb3ef058b751a6ad-s.p.woff2`, `e4af272ccee01ff0-s.p.woff2`. The owner's condition — "font preloaded when the intro renders" — was therefore already satisfied on `main`, before Task 11/11b touched anything. `07844ae7c4262727` is the *duplicate* Space Grotesk 700 instance that `IntroLoader.tsx` used to declare on its own (see commit `9ee8ff5`, "perf: drop duplicate font instances"); the other three (`36966cca`, `e4af272c`, `bb3ef058`) are the shared Space Grotesk / Inter / JetBrains Mono instances now centralized in `src/app/fonts.ts`. This branch's net effect on production preload count is **4 → 3** (removing the IntroLoader duplicate), not "0 → 3/4" as earlier drafts of this report implied. Re-check `.next/static/media` after a local build to confirm the same three hashes/names still appear once the duplicate is gone.

The **local 0-preloads measurement below, and the About-mobile CLS 0.197 (pre-11b) → 0.000 (post-11b) result, were artefacts of a Windows-only Next.js build bug (vercel/next.js#57008), not evidence of a production regression or a production fix.** On this Windows dev machine, `next build` never populates `next-font-manifest.json` (see root cause below), so *every* local build — including `main` before this branch — measures 0 font preloads and the corresponding CLS penalty, even though production has always preloaded fonts. The **0.197 → 0.000 local delta reported here is real on this machine but is not a production improvement**: production's About-mobile CLS baseline was **0.240** (`docs/perf-baseline.md`), and that number decomposes as the **0.214 footer shift** (present on every route, fixed by Task 3's synchronous `RouteGuard`) plus **~0.026** from other sources — not the ~0.2 font-swap shift the local-only measurement suggested. In short: the About CLS fix that matters in production is RouteGuard (Task 3) and the other Phase A layout-shift work, not the font-preload change measured here.

**Root cause of the local-Windows 0 preloads (verified empirically, not the module-sharing theory the brief hypothesized):** moving the `next/font` calls into `src/app/fonts.ts` (imported directly by `layout.tsx`, re-exported from `once-ui.config.ts` for compatibility) is a harmless, worthwhile refactor (single source of truth for the three font instances), but on its own it did **not** produce any preload locally — reproduced with three different module structures (fonts still in `once-ui.config.ts` reachable from client components; isolated in `src/app/fonts.ts` with zero client reachability; forced into an actual client bundle via a throwaway test component) and all three produced an identically empty `.next/server/next-font-manifest.json` (`{"pages":{},"app":{}}`). The actual cause: on Windows, the webpack module `request` string for anything processed by `next-font-loader` uses backslashes (`...\next-font-loader\index.js?...`), but `next/dist/build/webpack/plugins/next-font-manifest-plugin.js` tests `mod.request.includes('/next-font-loader/index.js?')` — a forward-slash-only substring that can never match on Windows, so the manifest is never populated and no `<link rel=preload>`/preconnect is ever emitted on this machine, independent of source layout. This matches a publicly reported Next.js issue (vercel/next.js#57008, "font manifest files are empty"). On Linux (Vercel Preview/production), the same unpatched Next.js code already uses forward slashes, which is why production has preloaded these fonts all along, with or without this branch's `fonts.ts` refactor.

**How the local CLS/preload numbers below were measured:** the owner's binding constraint rules out any install-time script or committed patch of `node_modules` (no `postinstall`, no in-range `patch-package` dependency, no `patches/` directory — Vercel's build stays a plain `npm ci && next build`). To measure the *local* effect of the Windows bug despite it masking the preload, a one-line fix to `next-font-manifest-plugin.js`'s separator check was applied **temporarily, out-of-tree, and never committed** (edited directly under `node_modules/next`, `npm ci` afterward restores the pristine unpatched package — confirmed by `git diff d6b8c9e -- package.json package-lock.json` being empty and `patches/` not existing in this branch). The CLS/preload numbers below reflect that temporary local measurement only; they are **not** a checked-in fix, do not represent production behavior (production never needed this patch), and ship nothing to production.

**Preloads seen under that temporary local patch** (`.next/server/app/index.html` and `about.html`): `Space Grotesk` latin (`36966cca54120369-s.p.woff2`), `Inter` latin (`e4af272ccee01ff0-s.p.woff2`), and `JetBrains Mono` latin (`bb3ef058b751a6ad-s.p.woff2`) — the same three hashes confirmed live on production above, all `latin` subset only, no extra subsets (budget guard held). JetBrains Mono's preload is **load-bearing for About's CLS on this local, patched measurement**, not incidental: it was first shipped with `preload: false` (not visibly used above the fold on Home/Gallery), but Lighthouse's `layout-shifts`/`cls-culprits-insight` audit then attributed a residual **0.033** About-mobile CLS to that exact font file loading late on the sticky meta panel under the local patch. Restoring its preload (default `preload: true`, the shipped source state) brought the local, patched measurement's CLS to exactly 0.000. So the shipped `src/app/fonts.ts` intentionally preloads all three fonts on every route, not just Space Grotesk + Inter — matching what production already does.

### Lighthouse (median of 3), Vercel Preview vs production baseline

**Not run.** Per the controller's task split, this task (Task 11, Steps 1–5) stops before push/Preview/Step 7. The Preview Lighthouse run, its comparison against `docs/perf-baseline.md`'s production table, and the mobile Perf ≥ 95 / LCP < 2.0 s / CLS < 0.05 / TBT < 200 ms / First Load JS ≤ baseline budget check against a production-like environment are deferred to whoever runs Steps 6–8.

### First Load JS (`next build`)

| Route | Baseline | Quick wins | Δ |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/` | 311 kB | 312 kB | **+1 kB** |
| `/about` | 275 kB | 275 kB | 0 |
| `/work` | 309 kB | 310 kB | **+1 kB** |
| `/blog/[slug]` | 312 kB | 312 kB | 0 |
| `/gallery` | 286 kB | 286 kB | 0 |

`/`'s +1 kB is new as of the final fix wave (post-review): `LazyVideo.tsx` gained a small accessible pause/play toggle button (state, a derived label, and a `togglePlayback` handler) for WCAG 2.2.2, per finding 8 of the review. Confirmed via `npm run build` after that change. Within the same justified-allowance reasoning as `/work`'s +1 kB below — a small, accessibility-motivated addition, not chased further.

`/work/[slug]` (not in the budget table) also moved 309 kB → 310 kB, same +1 kB. All other routes are unchanged or match baseline exactly. The `/work` +1 kB is within the task brief's justified +10 kB allowance and was accepted: the YouTube facade (Task 7) removes the third-party YouTube iframe API from the initial bundle (~870 KB of third-party JS no longer loaded up front, see the Gallery JS row under "Assets" below), and the small shared-chunk growth from `YouTubeFacade.tsx`/`ProjectCard.tsx` is the tradeoff for that removal — not chased further since Step 11 is verification-only, not a code-change task.

### Assets

| | Baseline | Quick wins |
|---|---|---|
| `public/` total | 109 MB | 54 MB |
| Home video bytes on load | ~3.5 MB | 0 |
| Gallery JS incl. third parties | ~1212 KB | 342 KB |

### Video audio decisions

Source: `.perf/video-decisions.txt` (Task 6 optimization pass, plus a Task 6 fix round).

--- fix round 1 (2026-09-26) ---
Issue: canPlayWebm() preferred WebM for every non-Apple browser, but the VP9 pass produced a
LARGER file than the MP4 for all 5 videos, and 2 of the 5 MP4 re-encodes were themselves larger
than the pre-task originals. Fixed optimize-videos.mjs: (a) an MP4 re-encode is discarded and the
original bytes kept if the encode isn't strictly smaller ("KEPT ORIGINAL"); (b) a WebM sibling is
kept only if it ends up >=10% smaller than the final MP4, with one retry at crf+14 (vs the
original crf+8) before giving up and deleting it.

public/videohome.mp4: mp4 3,611,663 B -> 3,639,353 B at crf 32 (LARGER) -> KEPT ORIGINAL (3,611,663 B, 3.44MB) | 1280x720 | audio: none | !! OVER TARGET (1.2MB target)

public/images/projects/project-01/leadbot.mp4: mp4 3,466,938 B -> 2,455,421 B at crf 32 -> KEPT RECOMPRESSED (shrank) | 1402x720 | audio: none | !! OVER TARGET (1.2MB target)
  webm retry 1 (crf 40): 4,321,492 B (bigger than mp4, fail)
  webm retry 2 (crf 46): 2,978,325 B vs threshold 2,209,879 B (90% of mp4) -> still fails -> WEBM DELETED, not referenced

public/images/projects/project-01/chatbot-artesa.mp4: mp4 242,932 B -> 262,976 B at crf 26 (LARGER) -> KEPT ORIGINAL (242,932 B, 0.23MB) | 640x360 | audio: none
  webm retry 1 (crf 34): 299,882 B (bigger than mp4, fail)
  webm retry 2 (crf 40): 229,285 B vs threshold 218,639 B (90% of mp4) -> still fails -> WEBM DELETED, not referenced

  webm retry 2 (crf 42): 902,973 B vs threshold 852,966 B (90% of mp4) -> still fails -> WEBM DELETED, not referenced

public/images/projects/project-01/video-01.mp4: mp4 14,805,693 B -> 7,304,559 B at crf 32 -> KEPT RECOMPRESSED (shrank) | 1804x1080 | audio: none | !! OVER TARGET (4MB target) | unreferenced in src (rg check), deletion candidate
  webm retry 1 (crf 40): 8,649,579 B (bigger than mp4, fail)
  webm retry 2 (crf 46): 5,952,327 B vs threshold 6,574,103 B (90% of mp4) -> PASSES (18.5% smaller) -> WEBM KEPT

Final state: only public/images/projects/project-01/video-01.webm is kept and referenced (though
video-01.mp4 itself is unreferenced in src, so this webm currently ships to nobody either — flagged
alongside the mp4 as part of the same deletion candidate). public/videohome.webm and the other two
project WebMs no longer exist; src/app/page.tsx no longer passes `webm` to LazyVideo for Home.
```

On top of the recompression above, Task 6's lazy-video work (`preload="none"`, play only once in viewport, no autoplay under reduced-motion/save-data) means the Home video downloads **0 bytes in the initial HTML/document load** regardless of its 3.44 MB file size — confirmed both by `tests/e2e/lazy-video.spec.ts` (passing on chromium/mobile-chromium/firefox in this run) and by the Home "Media" transfer column not appearing among Lighthouse's byte totals above. **Qualification:** `LazyVideo`'s `IntersectionObserver` (threshold `0.25`) is attached in a post-hydration `useEffect`, not gated on a user scroll — so on a tall enough desktop viewport where the hero video is already ≥25% visible at load, it starts fetching/playing as soon as hydration completes, not only "when scrolled into view." The measured Lighthouse runs above (mobile/desktop presets, standard viewport heights) did not hit this case, but it should be described as "0 bytes until the video is ≥25% visible (in practice, after hydration on most viewports; immediately after hydration on tall desktop viewports where it's already in view)," not as an unconditional guarantee.

### Security checks

Source: `.perf/security-notes.txt` (Task 3 Step 8, server-side RouteGuard/protected-route verification) plus this task's Steps 2–3.

**Task 3 Step 8 summary (full text in `.perf/security-notes.txt`):**
- Without an auth cookie: `/work` returns `200` with `Cache-Control: no-store`, and 0 matches for protected content (`LeadBot AI`) across plain HTML, a dynamic child route (`/work/leadbot-ai`), and the RSC payload (`RSC: 1` header) — protected content is never sent to an unauthenticated request in any response shape.
- With a valid cookie (via `/api/authenticate` with the correct password, `200`): `/work` then returns ≥1 match for the protected content — the unlock path works.
- Disabled-route check (`/gallery: false`): comparing the new synchronous `RouteGuard` against the old (pre-fix) version at commit `e1a6d5a`, both return HTTP `200`, but only the new version renders the NotFound UI as real, visible server HTML (outside `<script>` tags) — the old version's server HTML instead contains the loading Spinner, with NotFound only present inside the client-hydration JSON payload. This is exactly the CLS root cause (0.214 footer shift) that Task 3 fixes; the branch's disabled-route status code is not worse than pre-fix (both 200).
- Cleanup was verified: temporary env-var-only credentials were never written to `.env.local`; `protectedRoutes.ts`/`once-ui.config.ts` test edits were reverted (confirmed via `git status --short`); `RouteGuard.tsx` restored to the fixed version; a final `npm run build` left the tree in the fixed, rebuilt state; test ports (3100, 3300) verified free afterward.

**Task 11 Steps 2–3 (this run):**
- **Step 2 — security headers vs production:** `curl -sI https://www.erickmahecha.com/` vs `curl -sI http://localhost:3100/` for `content-security-policy`, `x-frame-options`, `x-content-type-options`, `referrer-policy`, `permissions-policy`, `strict-transport-security`, `x-dns-prefetch-control`. Only one byte-level diff: `X-Dns-Prefetch-Control` (production, likely re-cased by Vercel's edge) vs `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control` (this branch, from Next.js directly) — HTTP header names are case-insensitive per RFC 7230, so this is not a functional difference. Every header's **value** is byte-identical, including the full CSP string. Not `HEADERS IDENTICAL` verbatim from `diff`, but semantically identical.
- **Step 3 — auth endpoints, branch vs production:**
  | Endpoint | Local branch (3100) | Production |
  |---|---|---|
  | `GET /api/check-auth` | 401 | 401 |
  | `POST /api/authenticate` (wrong password) | 500 | 500 |

  Codes match production in both cases — no regression. (The `500` on a wrong password, on both branch and production, is pre-existing behavior, not introduced by this branch; not investigated further as it's identical on both sides.)
- **Chatbot live check:** deferred to the Preview (Step 7, out of scope here) — this worktree has no `.env.local` (confirmed: only `.env.example` is present) and the brief requires it never be read, created, or copied.
- **`npm audit`:** see "Open items" — the `--omit=dev` count is **not** zero as the brief anticipated; the 3 production-dependency vulnerabilities are unrelated to this branch's new devDependencies (confirmed pre-existing: `package.json`'s `dependencies` and `overrides` are byte-identical to `main`; only `devDependencies` gained `@playwright/test` and `lighthouse`).

### Open items

- `videohome.mp4` remains **OVER TARGET** (3.44 MB, original kept — the recompression attempt was larger and was discarded; 0 bytes in the initial load in the common case, thanks to lazy-load — see the qualification above about tall desktop viewports where it's already ≥25% visible at hydration). Meeting the 1.2 MB target needs a resolution/trim decision by the owner.
- `leadbot.mp4` is 2.34 MB (**OVER TARGET**); `video-01.mp4`/`.webm` are unreferenced anywhere in `src` — deletion candidates (Erick decides).
- **Closed, corrected:** the owner condition "font preloaded when the intro renders" was already true on production **before this branch** — `curl` against `https://www.erickmahecha.com/` and `/about` confirms 4 `<link rel="preload" as="font">` tags on `main` today (see "Follow-up 11b" above for the hashes). This branch's `src/app/fonts.ts` refactor is a harmless consolidation of the three font instances (not the fix that made preloading happen — production never needed one), and its one functional effect on preload count is removing the duplicate IntroLoader Space Grotesk 700 instance, taking production from 4 preloads to 3. The local Windows measurement showing 0 preloads (and the About-mobile CLS 0.197→0.000 swing) never reflected production; it was entirely an artefact of the Windows-only Next.js font-manifest bug (vercel/next.js#57008 — `next-font-manifest-plugin.js`'s path-separator check never matches on Windows). No install-time patch was shipped (confirmed: `git diff d6b8c9e -- package.json package-lock.json` is empty, no `patches/` directory, no `postinstall` script). **Next step (optional, low priority):** confirm on the Vercel Preview that the 3 expected preload hashes (`36966cca`, `e4af272c`, `bb3ef058`) are present and `07844ae7` is gone, matching the production `curl` check already done against `main`.
- `public/images/og/home.jpg` (1.6 aspect ratio) is cropped ~10% by the 16:9 carousel on the oldest `/work` card; the Plan 2 index change is expected to replace this carousel.
- `npm audit`: **full** `npm audit` reports **24 vulnerabilities (17 moderate, 6 high, 1 critical)**. `npm audit --omit=dev` reports **3 vulnerabilities (2 high, 1 critical)** — **not 0**, contrary to what the brief anticipated. These 3 (`next` critical RCE advisory, `sharp` high, `js-yaml` via `gray-matter`) are pre-existing production-dependency issues, unrelated to this branch (verified: `package.json`'s `dependencies`/`overrides` sections are unchanged from `main`; only `devDependencies` gained `@playwright/test` and `lighthouse`). The remaining 21 (17 moderate + 4 high) come from the new devDependencies' own dependency chain (Lighthouse → puppeteer-core → `@puppeteer/browsers` → `extract-zip`), all dev-only, not shipped to production.
- iOS YouTube single-tap check pending (Erick, on the Preview); `MUTE_ON_IOS = false` in `src/components/YouTubeFacade.tsx`.
- Extra line-level `biome-ignore` suppressions added in Task 1 (FaqChatbot regex loop, greeting bubble) and import-order-only formatting of the middleware/auth route files. Biome also reformatted `src/app/api/chatbot/route.ts` (Task 1, commit `d27818a`): a multi-line, backslash-continued template-string concatenation in `buildSystemPrompt()` was collapsed into a single template literal. Verified byte-identical output — concatenating the original segments in order produces the exact same string as the new single template literal, including the embedded `${message}` interpolation and `\n` boundaries; no wording, whitespace, or prompt-injection-marker text changed.
- **New, found during this task's Step 1 gate run:** `/work` and `/work/[slug]` First Load JS grew **309 kB → 310 kB** (+1 kB), a small miss against the "≤ baseline" budget. Every other route matches or beats baseline exactly. Not chased further — Task 11 is verification-only.
- **New, found during this task's Step 1 gate run:** `tests/e2e/intro-font.spec.ts` failed on `mobile-chromium` (3 tests) — a genuine test defect from Task 10, not a product regression: its `test.skip(({ browserName }) => browserName !== "chromium", …)` only excludes Firefox/WebKit, because `mobile-chromium`'s underlying engine is also named `"chromium"` by Playwright, but Task 10 only captured/committed baseline screenshots for the desktop `chromium` project. Fixed here by skipping on `testInfo.project.name !== "chromium"` instead (same pattern already used in `tests/e2e/a11y-names.spec.ts`), matching the test's own stated intent ("reference frames are Chromium-only" = one desktop project, not every Chromium-engine project). No product code changed. Full suite is green after the fix: 105 passed, 27 skipped (declared), 0 failed.
- **Task 11b:** an install-time patch of `node_modules/next` (via `patch-package` + `postinstall`) was tried during this task to work around the Windows-only font-manifest bug (vercel/next.js#57008) so the preload fix could be measured locally, but was rejected on review (binding constraint: no postinstall/install-time scripts, no in-range devDependencies, Vercel build stays plain `next build`) and removed — `package.json`/`package-lock.json` are back to byte-identical with `d6b8c9e`, no `patches/` directory exists on this branch. The Windows bug therefore remains **unworked-around** in this repo; local measurement of the preload fix used a temporary, never-committed edit under `node_modules/next` instead (see "Follow-up 11b"). Preload emission on Linux (Preview/production) is expected to work without any patch, since the bug is Windows-path-specific, but has not yet been directly confirmed there — see the updated font-preload Open item above.
