## Overview

**LeadBot AI** is an AI-driven chatbot designed to automate B2B lead qualification and customer service conversations through WhatsApp.
The system was built to support high-volume inbound traffic from paid campaigns while ensuring the sales team received fully qualified leads with actionable context.

## The Challenge

Artesa’s commercial team was receiving a growing number of inbound leads from paid media campaigns, but manual handling created delays, context loss, and operational overload.

Key challenges included:
- **Limited human capacity** to respond quickly to inbound WhatsApp leads.
- **Data gaps** where sales reps started conversations without essential qualification data.
- **Complex business model** (B2B and B2C) requiring different rules, messaging, and information boundaries.
- **No dedicated support**, lacking a customer service department to handle general inquiries.

The business needed a solution that could qualify B2B leads automatically, handle general B2C questions, and route only high-quality opportunities to the sales team.

## The Solution

I designed and implemented **LeadBot AI**, an AI-powered chatbot operating through WhatsApp Business, fully integrated into Bitrix24.

### Architecture & Integrations
Since Bitrix24 does not offer native WhatsApp integration, I first connected the WhatsApp Business API through an external provider.
- **BotSL IA**: A Bitrix24 Marketplace application used to create the AI-driven chatbot and connect open channels.
- **Meta Business**: The WhatsApp number was linked to Artesa’s Meta Business account, ensuring compliance and operational stability.

### AI Model Strategy
The chatbot is powered by **ChatGPT (GPT-4o mini)**, selected for its balance of:
- High conversational accuracy.
- Cost efficiency per token.
- Strong performance in customer service use cases.

This model choice allowed the system to scale without excessive operational costs.

### Conversational Intelligence & Training
Unlike traditional decision-tree chatbots, LeadBot AI operates using natural language understanding, allowing it to respond dynamically to a wide range of user inputs.

### Knowledge Design
To control accuracy and prevent hallucinations, I structured the chatbot’s knowledge base using custom documentation:
- **Artesa Communication Guidelines**
- **B2B Sales Manual**
- **B2C Sales Manual**

Each document defined the tone of voice, allowed/restricted information, and step-by-step conversation flows. These documents were created and refined using **Gemini 3 Pro** to maintain consistency across complex instructions.

### System Instructions & Control
Using **OpenAI’s Assistant Playground**, I designed detailed system instructions that defined:
- The chatbot’s role and personality.
- Response style and language rules.
- Information boundaries (e.g., no pricing for B2B leads).
- Data extraction logic for lead qualification.

The temperature was set to `0.10`, prioritizing accuracy and reliability over creativity — a critical decision for customer service and sales automation.

## The Impact

- **85% of customer conversations automated**, including initial prospecting and customer service inquiries.
- **24/7 lead qualification** without additional staff.
- **Enriched B2B leads** delivered to sales with product of interest, estimated volume, and location.
- **Reduced response times** and eliminated manual first-contact bottlenecks.
- **Scalable customer service** established despite having no dedicated support team.

LeadBot AI became a core operational system, improving efficiency, consistency, and conversion readiness across the commercial process.

## Key Takeaway

LeadBot AI demonstrates how AI, CRM integration, and thoughtful system design can replace manual workflows while preserving — and even improving — customer experience.

This project reflects my approach to automation: **build systems that understand users, respect business rules, and deliver real operational impact.**
