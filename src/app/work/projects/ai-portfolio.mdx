## Overview

This project represents a meta-layer of my work: **The portfolio itself.**

As a professional focused on automation and AI, I wanted my personal website to reflect my ability to use these tools not just for optimization, but for creation. I built this site using a **"Vibe Coding"** approach — collaborating with AI agents to write, debug, and deploy code without being a traditional developer.

## The Challenge

I needed a high-performance, professional-grade website to showcase my work in Marketing and Automation.
However, I didn't want to rely on generic "drag-and-drop" builders like Wix or Squarespace, which often lack flexibility and performance.

**My constraints:**
- **No deep coding knowledge:** I don't write React or TypeScript from scratch.
- **High standards:** I wanted a modern design, dark mode, fast loading speeds, and SEO optimization.
- **Custom functionality:** Specific layouts for my projects and gallery.

## The Solution

Instead of learning to code from zero, I treated the development process as an **automation workflow** where the AI acts as the "Junior Developer" and I act as the "Product Manager" and "Architect".

### The Workflow: Vibe Coding
1.  **Selection:** I chose a high-quality open-source template (Magic Portfolio) built on Next.js.
2.  **Prompt Engineering:** I used precise prompts to instruct AI agents to modify specific components, change layouts, and refactor code.
3.  **Iterative Debugging:** When errors occurred, I fed the error logs back to the AI to generate fixes, learning the logic of the system in the process.

### Deployment & Infrastructure
The site is hosted on **Vercel**, allowing for:
- Continuous Integration (CI/CD) connected to GitHub.
- Instant updates whenever I push changes.
- Global CDN for fast loading anywhere.

## The Impact

This project is proof of a new paradigm in digital creation: **Technical literacy is no longer about syntax, but about logic and system design.**

I was able to:
- Customize a complex Next.js application.
- Implement custom routing and content management (MDX).
- Deploy a production-ready site in record time.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (React) & TypeScript
- **Styling:** CSS Modules / Tokens
- **Development:** AI-Assisted (Vibe Coding)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **CMS:** MDX (Markdown)
