        I'm a one-person growth department. I've built complete marketing infrastructures: brand
        identity, paid media, CRM automation, SEO systems, and AI content production, for companies
        across construction, food, and retail. Most recently, I generated <Metric>338K+</Metric>{" "}
        organic video views for Quick Metal Shop with zero ad spend, using an AI production pipeline
        I designed and ran myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        My entry point into marketing wasn't a campaign. It was a crisis line.
        <br />
        <br />I spent two years at Concentrix managing security incidents, fraud cases, and
        technical failures for Mercado Pago users. That environment taught me something most
        marketers never learn firsthand: where systems break down, how users behave under pressure,
        and what it actually costs a business when processes fail at scale. It's an uncomfortable
        place to start. It's also an unusually useful one.
        <br />
        <br />
        That operational foundation pushed me toward a different kind of marketing. Not just
        running campaigns, but redesigning how businesses attract, qualify, and convert customers. I
        became focused on one question: what can be automated, and what's the cost of not automating
        it?
        <br />
        <br />
        The answer has taken different shapes across different projects. An AI-powered WhatsApp
        chatbot that handled <Metric>85%</Metric> of inbound conversations autonomously for Artesa.
        A full marketing department built from scratch for Quick Metal Shop (brand identity, paid
        media, SEO automation, CRM integration, and a custom-built trade show application deployed in{" "}
        <Metric>48 hours</Metric>).
        A complete rebranding and content automation system for Dakoma Roofing, delivered as a
        one-person freelance engagement.
        <br />
        <br />
        What connects all of it is the same approach: start with the operational reality, identify
        where human time is being consumed by work a system could handle, and build the
        infrastructure that removes that friction permanently.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today I work at the intersection of marketing strategy, AI tooling, and systems design. I
        don't run campaigns in isolation. I build the ecosystems that make campaigns compound over
        time: automated content pipelines, real-time lead qualification, full-funnel tracking, and
        creative production workflows that let a one-person operation output at agency scale.
        <br />
        <br />
        The work I find most interesting lives at the edge of what's currently possible with AI,
        which in 2026 is moving faster than most businesses realize.
