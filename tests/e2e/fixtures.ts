// WebKit does not treat `http://localhost` (or `127.0.0.1`) as a "potentially
// trustworthy origin" for `upgrade-insecure-requests`, unlike Chromium and
// Firefox. next.config.mjs's production CSP sends `upgrade-insecure-requests`
// (correctly — real HTTPS deployments need it) together with
// Strict-Transport-Security. Under Playwright WebKit against our local
// `next start` server (plain HTTP, per playwright.config.ts), that upgrades
// every subresource the document references — CSS, JS chunks, images — to
// `https://`, which then fails to connect since the local server has no TLS
// listener, breaking every page's rendering.
//
// This fixture strips only the `content-security-policy` and
// `strict-transport-security` response headers from the *document* request,
// and only on WebKit against a localhost/127.0.0.1 baseURL — every other
// resource type, browser, and base URL (e.g. a Vercel Preview deployment) is
// left untouched. Production CSP itself is still verified on the real
// deployment and by the header diff in Task 11; this only works around a
// WebKit-vs-plain-HTTP test environment artifact, not a product behaviour.
