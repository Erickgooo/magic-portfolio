// Pre-existing console errors observed on this build, unrelated to the
// harness itself (see docs/perf-baseline.md § "Known console errors").
//
// Chromium's console text for a failed resource load is generic and does not
// include the resource's URL ("Failed to load resource: the server responded
// with a status of 404 (Not Found)" / "... 400 (Bad Request)"), so matching by
// text alone would silently swallow ANY new 404/400 on ANY page. Each entry
// below is therefore matched on the exact text AND the failing resource's
// URL, and (for the gallery-only entries) the route as well — anything that
// doesn't match on all of those still fails the test.
//
// The failing resource's URL comes from `msg.location().url` for a
// "Failed to load resource" message (that's where Chromium puts it — the
// text itself doesn't carry it), and from the message text itself for the
// "Refused to execute script" message (Chromium embeds the URL directly in
// that text). Observed once via a throwaway debug script during development
// (not committed):
//   404 "Failed to load resource...": location().url = "http://localhost:3100/_vercel/insights/script.js"
//
// Firefox and WebKit word some of these messages differently (or don't log
// some of them at all — see docs/perf-baseline.md for the full per-browser
// breakdown observed running this same suite against each browser project).
// Entries below that are worded identically across browsers (and whose text
// still embeds/derives the same `urlIncludes`) are left unscoped; entries
// whose *text* differs per browser carry a `browsers` allow-list so a
// mismatch on one browser can't accidentally swallow a different browser's
// real error.
